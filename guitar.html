                <h2>History</h2>
                <hr class="subsection-divider">
                <p>During the fifteenth century, the roots of the guitar began to take shape. Its early predecessors, such as the lute and vihuela, laid the groundwork for the instrument we now know as the guitar. These early forms featured various numbers of strings and intricate designs, reflecting the diversity of musical styles emerging during that era.</p>
                <p>As time progressed, the guitar underwent several transformations. In the sixteenth century, the guitar gained popularity in Spain, becoming an integral part of Spanish culture.</p>
                <p>By the nineteenth century, innovations like the use of metal strings and the development of the classical guitar solidified its presence in classical music. Simultaneously, the folk and country music scenes embraced the acoustic guitar, which played a pivotal role in capturing the essence of rural life and storytelling.</p>
                <p>However, it was in the twentieth century that the guitar truly came into its own. The advent of the electric guitar in the early 1930s revolutionized music. With the ability to amplify its sound, the electric guitar fueled the birth of rock 'n' roll, blues, and countless other genres, influencing generations of musicians.</p>
